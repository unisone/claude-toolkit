Two essential tools that supercharge AI-powered development workflows. Works with **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Codex**, or any AI coding assistant.

## Features

### 🔍 Techdebt Scanner

Automated code quality detection that finds:
- 📋 Duplicated code patterns
- 💀 Dead/unreachable code  
- 📝 TODO/FIXME/HACK markers
- 🔒 Type safety gaps (TypeScript)
- 📦 Dependency hygiene
- 📏 File size violations

**Perfect for:** End-of-session cleanup, PR reviews, CI/CD quality gates

### 🌳 Git Worktree Manager

Create parallel development environments without branch-switching chaos:
- 🚀 Isolated contexts for multi-tasking
- 🤖 Perfect for parallel AI agents
- 🔄 No rebuild thrashing
- 🧠 Preserve mental context

**Perfect for:** Multi-agent workflows, parallel features, bug fixes while developing

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# Run directly with npx (no install)
npx @unisone/claude-toolkit techdebt

# Or install globally
npm install -g @unisone/claude-toolkit

# Or clone and use directly
git clone https://github.com/unisone/claude-toolkit
cd claude-toolkit
npm link
```

### Usage

#### Techdebt Scanner

```bash
# Scan current directory
techdebt

# Scan specific project
techdebt /path/to/project

# Auto-fix safe issues (unused imports, formatting)
techdebt --fix

# Summary only
techdebt --summary

# Generate markdown report
npx @unisone/claude-toolkit techdebt > techdebt-report.md
```

**Example output:**

```
CRITICAL (must fix before merge)
---------------------------------
[FILE_SIZE] src/Dashboard.tsx (547 lines)
  → Split into smaller components

[DUPLICATE] src/utils/validator.ts:45-67
  → Extract to shared utility

HIGH (fix this sprint)
----------------------
[TYPE_GAP] src/models/user.ts:34
  Function missing return type
  → Add explicit return type

SUMMARY
-------
Critical: 2
High: 3
Medium: 7
Low: 4
Total: 16 issues
```

#### Worktree Manager

```bash
# Create parallel worktrees
worktrees /path/to/repo

# Custom worktree names
worktrees /path/to/repo backend frontend testing

# Creates structure:
#   repo/              # Main (read-only)
#   repo-backend/      # Worktree 1
#   repo-frontend/     # Worktree 2
#   repo-testing/      # Worktree 3
```

**Then navigate with shell aliases:**

```bash
alias za='cd ~/Projects/repo-backend'
alias zb='cd ~/Projects/repo-frontend'
alias zc='cd ~/Projects/repo-testing'

# Jump between worktrees instantly
za  # → backend work
zb  # → frontend work (in parallel!)
```

**Cleanup when done:**

```bash
# Scripts also available directly
./scripts/worktrees/teardown-worktrees.sh /path/to/repo
```

## Claude Code Integration

### 1. Install the Skills

Drop any skill into your Claude workspace:

```bash
# Techdebt scanner — end-of-session code quality pass
cp skills/techdebt/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/techdebt.md

# PR review — senior-engineer-quality pull request reviews
cp skills/pr-review/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/pr-review.md

# Agent evals — eval suites with LLM-as-judge rubrics for prompts and agents
cp skills/agent-evals/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/agent-evals.md

# Code graph — build and query a knowledge graph of your codebase
cp skills/code-graph/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/code-graph.md

# Or symlink for auto-updates
ln -s $(pwd)/skills/techdebt/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/techdebt.md
```

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `techdebt` | Scan and fix code quality issues at the end of a coding session |
| `pr-review` | Review a GitHub PR like a senior engineer — blocking findings separated from nits |
| `agent-evals` | Build eval suites for prompts, skills, and agents with LLM-as-judge scoring |
| `code-graph` | Build and query a knowledge graph of a codebase — blast-radius analysis, callers, cycles |

### 2. Multi-Agent Worktree Pattern

Use worktrees to run multiple Claude agents in parallel without conflicts:

```bash
# Setup parallel worktrees
worktrees ~/Projects/my-app agent-refactor agent-tests agent-docs

# Spawn sub-agents, each in their own worktree
claude spawn --label refactor --workdir ~/Projects/my-app-agent-refactor
claude spawn --label tests --workdir ~/Projects/my-app-agent-tests  
claude spawn --label docs --workdir ~/Projects/my-app-agent-docs
```

Each agent works in isolation. No file conflicts. Clean merges.

## Configuration

### Techdebt Scanner

Create `.techdebt.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "fileSize": {
    "warning": 300,
    "critical": 500
  },
  "functionSize": {
    "warning": 50,
    "critical": 100
  },
  "duplicateThreshold": 10,
  "excludePaths": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist",
    "build"
  ],
  "autoFix": {
    "unusedImports": true,
    "formatting": false
  }
}
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
name: Code Quality
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  techdebt:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npx @unisone/claude-toolkit techdebt
```

**Pre-commit hook:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
npx @unisone/claude-toolkit techdebt --summary
```

## Why This Toolkit?

### The AI Coding Velocity Problem

**AI assistants ship fast. Quality control can't keep up.**

When you have Claude, Cursor, or Codex generating thousands of lines per session:
- **Technical debt accumulates faster than humans can review**
- **Parallel agents create branch chaos** (Agent A conflicts with Agent B)
- **Context switching kills productivity** (branch checkout = rebuild = 5min lost)
- **Type safety erodes** (`any` types slip through, `@ts-ignore` proliferates)
- **Dead code piles up** (commented blocks, failed experiments)

This toolkit solves both problems: **automated quality checks** + **conflict-free parallelization**.

### The Parallel Agents Trend

**Worktrees are becoming the standard for AI-native development:**

- **[Codex macOS app](https://codexmac.com)** — Uses worktrees for multi-agent orchestration
- **[AirOps](https://www.airops.com/)** — Built `worktree-cli` for parallel agent workflows
- **[Medium articles](https://medium.com/search?q=git+worktrees+ai)** — Growing coverage of worktree patterns for AI coding
- **[Boris Cherny (2019)](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/06/26/parallelize-development-git-worktrees/)** — Pioneered parallel worktree development

**Why now?** AI agents made parallelization essential. Traditional branch-switching workflows break when you have:
- 3 agents refactoring different modules simultaneously
- Production hotfix needed while feature branch is mid-build
- Experimental refactor running alongside stable development

Git worktrees solve this. This toolkit makes them **trivial to use**.
